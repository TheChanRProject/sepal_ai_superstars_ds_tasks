## Medical Scribe App JSON Schema Generation

### Request

You are a machine learning engineer (MLE) working on a medical scribe app that will reduce administrative burden on physicians within a private practice. As a part of the application development process, you want to capture patient-level insights as well as important conversational metadata between a patient and an attending physician during the patient visit.

### Deliverable

Using the audio file, `patient_visit_conversation.mp3`, generate an appropriate JSON schema, `conversation_schema.json`, that can capture important metadata about the conversation in a speaker-diarized fashion.
