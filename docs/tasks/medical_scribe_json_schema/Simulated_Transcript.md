## Transcript

**Physician:** Good morning. I'm Dr. Harrison. Please, have a seat. I see from the intake form that you've been experiencing some headaches. Can you tell me more about what's been going on?

**Patient:** Yes, thank you for seeing me. Um, the headaches have been... they've been really bad. I think they started maybe a week ago? Or maybe longer. I'm honestly having trouble remembering exactly when.

**Physician:** That's okay. Can you describe the headaches for me? Where exactly do you feel the pain?

**Patient:** It's mostly here, in the front, behind my eyes. But it also wraps around to the back of my head. And there's this sharp pain in my neck too. Like, right at the base of my skull.

**Physician:** I see. On a scale of one to ten, with ten being the worst pain you've ever felt, how would you rate these headaches?

**Patient:** Probably a seven or eight. Sometimes higher. They wake me up at night.

**Physician:** So you're having trouble sleeping because of the pain?

**Patient:** Yes. I can't get comfortable. The neck pain makes it hard to find a position that doesn't hurt. And when I do fall asleep, I wake up a few hours later with the headache pounding.

**Physician:** How many hours of sleep would you say you're getting each night?

**Patient:** Maybe three or four? It's been like this for... I want to say a week? I'm sorry, I'm having a hard time keeping track of things lately.

**Physician:** What do you mean by having a hard time keeping track of things?

**Patient:** Well, like... my husband told me this morning that we had a whole conversation yesterday about our dinner plans, and I have absolutely no memory of it. And I keep forgetting appointments. I missed a work meeting on Tuesday because I just... it didn't register that I had it.

**Physician:** How far back does this memory difficulty seem to go?

**Patient:** It's mostly recent stuff. I can remember things from years ago just fine. But this past week is like... foggy. There are gaps. My husband says I've asked him the same questions multiple times in one day.

**Physician:** That must be frustrating for you.

**Patient:** It's terrifying, honestly. I'm only forty-two. I shouldn't be forgetting conversations from yesterday.

**Physician:** Have you tried anything to manage the headaches?

**Patient:** Yes, I've been taking Tylenol. The eight hundred milligram ones.

**Physician:** And how are you taking those? With water, with food?

**Patient:** Oh, I actually have a really hard time swallowing pills. I always have. So I dissolve them in water first and wait until they're completely broken down before I drink it. I know it probably tastes awful, but it's the only way I can get them down.

**Physician:** How often have you been taking the Tylenol?

**Patient:** Um, probably every four to six hours? I've been trying to stay on top of the pain.

**Physician:** For how long have you been taking it at that frequency?

**Patient:** Since the headaches started. So about a week, I think.

**Physician:** Okay. I want to make sure we're monitoring that. Have you noticed any other symptoms? Nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light?

**Patient:** Some light sensitivity, yes. Bright lights make the headache worse. And I've felt a little nauseous, but I haven't actually thrown up.

**Physician:** Any changes in your vision? Blurriness, double vision, seeing spots?

**Patient:** Now that you mention it, I have noticed some blurriness. I thought I just needed to update my glasses prescription.

**Physician:** When did the blurry vision start?

**Patient:** I'm not sure. Recently. Within the past week, I suppose.

**Physician:** Have you had any recent injuries? Falls, car accidents, anything where you might have hit your head?

**Patient:** I... I don't think so. But honestly, with my memory being what it is right now, I'm not a hundred percent certain.

**Physician:** Has anyone witnessed you having any falls or injuries?

**Patient:** My husband hasn't mentioned anything. But he works during the day, so he's not always home.

**Physician:** Any fever or chills?

**Patient:** No, I don't think so.

**Physician:** Numbness or tingling anywhere in your body? Weakness in your arms or legs?

**Patient:** My fingers have felt a little tingly. I thought maybe I was sleeping on my arm wrong.

**Physician:** Which hand?

**Patient:** The left one, mostly.

**Physician:** I'd like to do a physical examination, particularly a neurological exam. Based on what you're describing—the severe headaches with neck pain, the memory difficulties with recent events, the visual changes, and the tingling—I'm concerned we may be dealing with something more than tension headaches.

**Patient:** What do you think it could be?

**Physician:** There are several possibilities we need to explore. The combination of anterograde amnesia—that's the difficulty forming new memories you've been experiencing—along with the headaches, neck pain, and neurological symptoms could indicate a few different conditions. It could be related to increased intracranial pressure, possibly a cerebrospinal fluid issue, or even something affecting the cervical spine that's impacting blood flow. There's also a possibility of a Chiari malformation, where brain tissue extends into the spinal canal.

**Patient:** That sounds serious.

**Physician:** It's certainly something we need to investigate thoroughly. I'm going to order some imaging—an MRI of your brain and cervical spine. I'd also like to do some blood work to rule out other causes. Depending on what we find, we may need to do a lumbar puncture to check your cerebrospinal fluid pressure.

**Patient:** Okay. Whatever you think is necessary.

**Physician:** In the meantime, I want you to ease up on the Tylenol. Taking that much acetaminophen for an extended period can stress your liver. I'm going to prescribe something else for the pain that may be more effective for what you're experiencing.

**Patient:** Will it be in pill form? Because like I said, I really struggle with swallowing pills.

**Physician:** I'll make sure to prescribe something available in a dissolvable or liquid form. We'll find something that works for you.

**Patient:** Thank you. I really appreciate that.

**Physician:** Of course. Now, is there someone who can drive you home today? Given the memory issues and the severity of your symptoms, I don't want you driving.

**Patient:** My husband is in the waiting room. He drove me here.

**Physician:** Good. I'm also going to ask that someone stay with you at all times until we figure out what's going on. If your symptoms worsen—if you develop a high fever, if the headache becomes the worst headache of your life, if you have any weakness or numbness that spreads, or if you become confused or have difficulty speaking—I want you to go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?

**Patient:** Yes, I understand.

**Physician:** I'll have my nurse come in to draw blood and give you the imaging orders. We'll try to get you scheduled for the MRI within the next day or two. I'll call you personally when the results come in.

**Patient:** Thank you, Dr. Harrison. I've been so worried. It helps to know someone is taking this seriously.

**Physician:** We're going to figure this out together. Try to rest as much as you can, stay hydrated, and keep a notepad handy to write down anything important—it can help with the memory difficulties in the short term.

**Patient:** That's a good idea. I'll do that.

**Physician:** Do you have any other questions for me before we proceed with the exam?

**Patient:** I don't think so. Not right now, anyway.

**Physician:** Alright. Let's begin the neurological examination, and then we'll get you set up with those tests.
